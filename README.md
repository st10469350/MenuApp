Changelog


From the feedback I received from my lecturer in Part 2, I fixed the issue where the Picker overlapped other input fields in the Add Menu screen. I adjusted the spacing and layout, so each input field is properly aligned and easier to read. I also fixed the layout of the Home (Menu) screen, where the top components were squashed together, by adding more padding and spacing for a cleaner look. The form now scrolls smoothly, and the keyboard no longer covers input fields when typing.



Refactoring and Improvements


During refactoring, I improved the app’s design and user experience. I updated the colour scheme to a consistent warm tone and added shadows and rounded corners to the cards for a polished look. I introduced validation alerts for missing or invalid input, improved the display of images and descriptions on menu cards, and added a total items counter to the menu screen. I also enhanced navigation flow between screens and made sure the layout adapts well on different devices. Overall, the app is now more user-friendly, visually appealing, and functions smoothly.
